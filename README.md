### Drummers' Gear Check

I have designed a web application for drummers to keep track of their equipment list, upcoming shows, and what they will need to take to each show. That way they won't be scrambling at the last minute and can actually check that they have everything they need. Being a drummer myself, I thought it would be a nice idea to have something to keep me up with my show diary, as well as a list of what I will need to take each time.
